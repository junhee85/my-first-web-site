    <p>The Wayback Machine is a digital time capsule created by the Internet Archive . Alexa Internet is being
        maintained with its content. In this archive, called a "three-dimensional index", users can view web pages that
        have been preserved through time.

        Preserved web pages are published after 6 to 12 months of storage. This is because the storage period is
        different. It doesn't track and log the website for every update, but it stores them every few weeks.</p>
